Leveraging the FastTree machine learning algorithm, it categorizes women into different behavioral classes based on features like age, physical activity, and other public profile data.\n\nAs the rate of marriage is plummeting globally and many men are increasingly abandoning traditional dating avenues, this AI software presents a potential solution to make the dating landscape easier for men and less traumatic, as they are usually the ones taking the initiative at the start of a potential relationship.\n\n**Note:** This machine learning model powering this software and the training data are both **not publicly available** to prevent any potential misuse or inappropriate applications. The model was trained with strict ethical guidelines and was developed purely for academic and research purposes which would later be published and referenced here.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Future Plans\nThere are plans to convert more categorical features into numerical values for model training, using the level of scantiness in different aspects of the dating profiles. This means that the AI will start considering the specific kinds of information a Nigerian woman chooses to share and what she omits as predictors of her behavior. This feature will allow the model to become even more nuanced and accurate in its predictions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Diagram of the Brain of the AI based on FastTree Algorithm\n\n![model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f52787b4-ec10-423e-b4ef-99f56a01920e)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Performance\nThe AI boasts a **macro accuracy of 89%**, validated through **5-fold cross-validation**. It offers predictions for various classifications of women, with results that adjust based on the scoring assigned to each class. Predictions include 15 categories such as \"serious,\" \"friend,\" \"Gamer,\" and more, depending on the input data.\n\nThe AI may classify a woman into up to 4 classes, especially when her public profile information is scanty, indicating the level of difficulty in classifying her behavior accurately. To make predictions, the software prompts users with a series of questions about the woman’s dating profile. The answers are then sent to the machine learning model to make the predictions, along with a percentage score for each prediction, so users can gauge the AI's confidence level in making those classifications.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Challenges Faced\nDuring the development and data gathering process for BumbleFormula, I encountered several challenges:\n\n1. **Identifying distinct behaviors**: One of the primary challenges was to initially identify and classify different behaviors of women on Bumble, which required careful data collection and observation.\n\n2. **Swiping as fast as possible**: To gather enough data, I used software to swipe as fast as possible. This automated swiping helped in quickly matching with a lot of women, from which their public data will be collected.\n\n3. **Subscribing to Bumble Premium**: I had to subscribe to Bumble's premium service to gain unlimited swipes, ensuring I had enough interactions for data collection.\n\n4. **Ensuring equal treatment**: It was crucial to treat all the women in the study the same way, so as not to introduce any external variables that could influence their behavior and jeopardize the data and predictions.\n\n5. **Maintaining appearance**: I had to make sure I looked as attractive as possible to maximize the number of matches. My appearance played a role in making it possible for me to have enough matches and get enough public data.\n\n6. **Controlling emotional reactions**: I had to control my anger from rude behaviors or rejections to avoid letting these experiences influence how I interacted with subsequent women. Emotional bias could have skewed the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Legal Compliance\n**BumbleFormula** adheres to Nigerian data protection regulation (NDPR) and privacy laws. **Multiple legal consultations** were sought from experienced lawyers in Nigeria to ensure full compliance with Nigerian data laws. This guarantees that the data used to train the AI is properly handled and respects the privacy rights of individuals.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Key Features\n- **Input Data**: Publicly available information from dating profiles.\n- **Classification**: The model scores behavior predictions across multiple classes, outputting only classes where predictions score over a defined threshold.\n- **Accuracy**: 89% macro accuracy, cross-validated.\n- **Dynamic Classification**: Capable of classifying women into up to 4 classes even when public profile information is limited, highlighting classification challenges.\n- **Interactive Profiling**: The software ask questions about the woman’s dating profile and converts the responses to numbers behind the scene and then sends all of these to the machine learning model behind to make predictions, with confidence scores in % provided for each prediction.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Responsible Use\nThis AI is intended to be used for **ethical, academic, and research purposes only**. Given the sensitive nature of predicting behavior, it is crucial that this tool be used responsibly to avoid any harmful implications or invasion of privacy. We have made the decision to **keep the machine learning model and training data private** to ensure it is not used in ways that could exploit or manipulate individuals.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The link to the source code can be found here: \n\n[BumbleFormula Source Code on GitHub](http://https://github.com/Brainydaps/BumbleFormula)","metadata":{}}]}
