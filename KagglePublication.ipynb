Leveraging the FastTree machine learning algorithm, it categorizes women into different behavioral classes based on features like age, physical activity, and other public profile data.\n","\n","As the rate of marriage is plummeting globally and many men are increasingly abandoning traditional dating avenues, this AI software presents a potential solution to make the dating landscape easier for men and less traumatic, as they are usually the ones taking the initiative at the start of a potential relationship.\n","\n","**Note:** This machine learning model powering this software and the training data are both **not publicly available** to prevent any potential misuse or inappropriate applications. The model was trained with strict ethical guidelines and was developed purely for academic and research purposes which would later be published and referenced here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c3a457ff","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.003165,"end_time":"2024-09-10T03:54:16.485725","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-10T03:54:16.48256","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["![Bumble Formula AI Software](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6dd2021-e0f5-476f-a001-95c2d47e3fd1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ba6c1169","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.003101,"end_time":"2024-09-10T03:54:16.492382","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-09-10T03:54:16.489281","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Future Plans\n","There are plans to convert more categorical features into numerical values for model training, using the level of scantiness in different aspects of the dating profiles.

My appearance played a role in making it possible for me to have enough matches and get enough public data.\n","\n","6. **Controlling emotional reactions**: I had to control my anger from rude behaviors or rejections to avoid letting these experiences influence how I interacted with subsequent women.
